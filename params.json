{"name":"Php-rosetta","tagline":"Dynamic text for PHP ","body":"### Php-Rosetta\r\nPhp-Rosetta can be used to handle dynamic text in a PHP project. It was originally developed to support easy translation, but it could be used in any situation which requires dynamic text where loading values out of an XML dictionary would be appropriate. It's released under the LGPL. The original developer was [Jake Taylor](https://github.com/jacobneiltaylor), but it has been modified and uploaded here so that others may use it. \r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n```\r\n//Load some xml into a string...\r\n//...\r\n$rosetta = new rosetta(rosetta::makeLanguage($str)); //we need one language at least\r\necho $rosetta->getString('hello');\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
